Description: Builds a typed knowledge graph of an R project's structure
    for use with large language models. The graph encodes functions, files,
    packages, and tests as nodes, with call, import, and test edges capturing
    dependencies. Supports TF-IDF embeddings out-of-the-box, with optional
    Ollama and OpenAI backends.
